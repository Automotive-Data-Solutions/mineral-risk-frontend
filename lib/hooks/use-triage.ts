/**
 * Data hooks for the triage queue — React Query edition.
 *
 * Migrated 2026-08-05 from hand-rolled useState/useEffect hooks; this was the
 * last hand-rolled hook file in the app (every other lib/hooks module already
 * used React Query). What the migration deletes rather than reimplements:
 * the manual request-sequence guards against out-of-order responses (query
 * keys make stale responses unlandable), the page-level refetch chain after
 * every mutation (one `invalidateQueries` on the `triage` key family), and
 * duplicate uncoordinated fetches when multiple components need the same
 * data (RQ dedupes by key).
 *
 * The queue is a write-heavy work surface, so these queries deliberately keep
 * the global 30s staleTime — freshness after a decision comes from mutation
 * invalidation, not from short staleness. `placeholderData: prev` preserves
 * the old hooks' no-skeleton-flash behaviour between a decision and its
 * confirmed result.
